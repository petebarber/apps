				<ul>
					<li>No account details are stored by this app.</li>
					<li>When authorizing from the iOS App an OAuth2 Token is obtained from Microsoft OneDrive.<li>
					<ul>
						<li>This is stored in iCloud using the iCloud account that is currently signed in.</li> 
						<li>The token is made available to the corresponding Apple TV App.</li>
						<li>As far as I am aware the token is stored securely using iCloud security.</li>
						<li>The token supplied from Microsoft OneDrive is valid for an hour.</li>
						<li>If iCloud on Apple TV is signed out of and/or the App is signed out of then the token is deleted.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>As far as I am aware no Microsoft OneDrive nor iCloud account information is stored by either the iOS or Apple TV Apps. The sign-in process for Microsoft OneDrive does apparently leave a cookie on the device so when authorizing in the future the Microsoft Account login can be bypassed by Microsoft. This can be removed from the iOS App using the Sign Out button.</li> 
					<li>Photone (both the authorisation & viewer apps) does not track any usage of the App itself nor of any photos viewed.</li>
