			<p>When visiting new places and wondering or driving around would you like a record of your route? You can do this with a lot of apps but these tend to use GPS tracking which consumes a lot of power. Follow uses a less well known feature of iOS location tracking which is only updating your position when you move from one mobile cell to another and/or through WiFi connections. This reduces the accuracy but vastly improves the battery life whilst creating a useful trail.</p>
			<p>Follow creates a visual route of your current journey overlaid on a map. This can be discarded anytime or saved to create a history of memorable journeys which can be reviewed later. For the current journey, distance traveled and the current latitude and longitude are displayed.</p>
			<p>If battery life is not an issue then GPS based tracking can be enabled along with specifying the distance in between GPS updates. When travelling faster these can be reduced.</p>
			<p>Follow works both with iPhone & iPad including iPads without cellular hardware.</p>

			<p class="app-title">Simple Noughts and Crosses</p>
			<p>A simple version of Noughts and Crosses (also known as Tic-Tac-Toe). A running total is kept of wins, losses and draws (which is reset when 10 is reached). Initially crosses start and then it's the losing player or in the event of a draw then starting player alternates.</p>
			<p>Simple Noughts and Crosses supports two human players competing as well as player vs AI with the AI having 3 levels of difficulty. Tap the AI/Difficultly Level number button in the middle of Player information to select a human player or the desired difficulty level.</p>
			<p>Additionally, AI vs AI is possible. It's quite fun & relaxing watching two AIs complete especially when they're at different difficulty levels. At any time you can switch AI level or to back and forth to a human player.</p>
			<p>This is a universal app supporting both iPhone & iPad. It works in both portrait and landscape modes.</p>
