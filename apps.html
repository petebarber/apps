			<h2 class="app-title">Photone for OneDrive</h2>
			<p>Photone allows you to view your photos (everything in the Photos folders) from Microsoft OneDrive on the latest Apple TV.</p>
			<p>If you have many (I have 17000+) photos then Photone does not wait for all the information to be downloaded before displaying any thumbnails. Instead photos become available as soon as possible. When downloading thumbnails multiple are downloaded simaltaneously giving you quick access to your photos & videos.</p>
			<p>It consists on an iOS App that is used to sign in to OneDrive and obtain an access token (that is valid for one hour) that is then saved to your iCloud account. This is required as it is not yet possible to sign in to OneDrive directly from Apple TV.</p>
			<p>The main App is for Apple TV which using your synchronized iCloud account is able to obtain the access token which can be used to sign in to OneDrive and download your photos.</p>
			<p>The access token is only valid for one hour (the expiration time is shown on the iOS App). After this time you will need to re-authorize via the iOS App.</p>
			<p>You can remove the access token from either version of the App. If you sign out of iCloud the token remains valid until its expiration time but if you sign in as another user than it will be replaced.</p>

			<h2 class="app-title">Follow</h2>
			<p>When visiting new places and wondering or driving around would you like a record of your route? You can do this with a lot of apps but these tend to use GPS tracking which consumes a lot of power. Follow uses a less well known feature of iOS location tracking which is only updating your position when you move from one mobile cell to another and/or through WiFi connections. This reduces the accuracy but vastly improves the battery life whilst creating a useful trail.</p>
			<p>Follow creates a visual route of your current journey overlaid on a map. This can be discarded anytime or saved to create a history of memorable journeys which can be reviewed later. For the current journey, distance traveled and the current latitude and longitude are displayed.</p>
			<p>If battery life is not an issue then GPS based tracking can be enabled along with specifying the distance in between GPS updates. When travelling faster these can be reduced.</p>
			<p>Follow works both with iPhone & iPad including iPads without cellular hardware.</p>

			<h2 class="app-title">Simple Noughts and Crosses</h2>
			<p>A simple version of Noughts and Crosses (also known as Tic-Tac-Toe). A running total is kept of wins, losses and draws (which is reset when 10 is reached). Initially crosses start and then it's the losing player or in the event of a draw then starting player alternates.</p>

			<p>Additionally, AI vs AI is possible. It's quite fun & relaxing watching two AIs complete especially when they're at different difficulty levels. At any time you can switch AI level or to back and forth to a human player.</p>
			<p>This is a universal app supporting both iPhone & iPad. It works in both portrait and landscape modes.</p>

			<p>To mark items as complete tap on the round button and if find there's still a bit more to do tap on it again to mark as needing some attention.</p>

Simple instructions are provided before each level. These are shown automatically the first time you play and afterwards can be summoned by pressing the '?' button.</p>
			<p>There is only one goal: get the highest score! You can't die but it's hard to get the maximum score.</p>
